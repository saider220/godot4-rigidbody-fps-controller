This is a basic rigidbody controller that can be used as a solid base for any movement mechanic in your project

If using outside of this project make sure to:
  1. Install and setup Godot Jolt from the asset store
  2. Install and setup Interpolation Plugin (for smooth movement) https://github.com/lawnjelly/smoothing-addon/tree/4.x
  3. Set the project default gravity to 30
